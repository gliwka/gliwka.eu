I use the collected information solely for the purposes described above: to operate and improve my blog, to publish user-submitted comments, to send newsletters to subscribers, and to respond to inquiries.

## 4. Data Sharing and Third-Party Processors

I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties, except as described below:

This ensures that data transferred to US-certified companies is protected to EU standards. As a fallback measure, I also rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

I ensure that all third-party processors comply with data protection regulations and adequately protect your data.

## 7. Contact Me

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, my data practices, or wish to exercise your rights, please contact me at:

**privacy@gliwka.eu**

## 8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

This website **does not use cookies** or similar tracking technologies (such as localStorage, web beacons, or tracking pixels) for any purpose. You can browse my website without any cookies being set by me.

For your protection, this website also explcitily opts out of FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) tracking provided by your browser.

## 9. International Data Transfers

My website is delivered globally through bunny.net's Content Delivery Network (CDN), which operates servers in multiple countries across 6 continents. When you access my website, the following applies:

* **Technical Data Routing:** On a technical level, when you connect to my website, your request may be routed to the nearest CDN server to optimize loading times. This means that if you are located outside the European Union, your connection data (such as IP address and user agent) may be temporarily processed by CDN servers in your region to deliver the website content to you efficiently.
* **Data Processing and Storage:** bunny.net anonymizes any data that could be used to directly or indirectly identify a user. By default, bunny.net anonymizes IP addresses by removing the last octet from the address. When IP anonymization is disabled for logging purposes, all logs are stored within the EU. bunny.net is an EU-based company (BunnyWay d.o.o., Slovenia) that operates under GDPR and maintains a privacy-first approach.
* **Purpose of Global CDN:** The sole purpose of this international data routing is to provide you with fast website loading times regardless of your geographic location.
* **GDPR Compliance:** bunny.net is fully committed to complying with the GDPR and has taken steps to ensure no personally identifiable data is stored from your users that access your services through bunny.net. This processing is covered by my legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) in providing an efficient, globally accessible website while respecting user privacy through bunny.net's anonymization practices.

If you have concerns about international data transfers, please contact me at privacy@gliwka.eu.

## 10. Automated Decision-Making

I do not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling activities as defined under Article 22 GDPR. Your personal data is not used to make automated decisions that produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you.
