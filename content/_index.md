Hi 👋 I'm a product-minded engineer with a knack for unblocking delivery. I've executed high-stakes migrations, rearchitected microservices to restore velocity, and shifted architecture practice from mandates to collaboration. I bridge deep technical work with the org alignment required to continously ship value.
